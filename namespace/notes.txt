-- A huge problem, name collision, which occurs when
different classes have the same name or have the same name for their methods. The problem is solved by using namespaces.

-- We define the namespace at the very top of the page with the namespace keyword.

-- import the namespace with the use keyword

-- namespace with a friendly name: We can also give the class a friendly name (also known as aliasing) by using the 'as' keyword.


-- global namespace?
	-- In order for classes from the global scope to be used securely within a namespace, we need to precede the name of such a class with a backslash.

	-- Some other common instances in which there is a need to use the backslash before the class
name are for the built in PHP extensions PDO and DateTime, and for PHPâ€™s generic empty
class, stdClass.


-- Can more than one namespace be imported into the same file?
	-- Each class that we import needs to have its own namespace.
